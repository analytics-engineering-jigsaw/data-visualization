    "One broader theme is that when working with a new dataset or domain we want to **start broad**, and then go narrow.  For example, we shouldn't just dive into looking at TV sales until we confirm that TV sales are worth our time.  By starting broadly, and seeing what drives a certain metric (like revenue), we can determine where to focus our energy, and a company's energy."
